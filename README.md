# Chocolate-Doom Plus

Welcome to the official Chocolate-Doom Plus!

This project is a fork of Chocolate-Doom that aims to implement the ability to raise or decrease the static limits according to Doom+ or Doom v1.2 respectively. 

These are the static limits of Doom plus: http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net/doom-plus.features.html

Doom v1.2 had lower static limits than later versions, because they were raised to accomodate Doom 2 which has bigger levels. Doom v1.2 compatibility is not the main objective though, it's only to make it easy to change the limits. Some changes are documented here, but may not be accurate: https://tcrf.net/Doom_(PC,_1993)/Revisional_Differences
